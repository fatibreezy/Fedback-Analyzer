# Fedback-Analyzer
# 🧠 Inclusive AI Feedback Platform for Nigerian Governance

### 3MTT Knowledge Showcase – May Edition | Category: AI-Powered Solutions

## 🚀 The Big Idea

Nigeria is filled with vibrant voices—elders, youths, market women, professionals—but many feel **unheard** on government policies. Most feedback systems are elitist, digital-only, or exclude people in rural areas. 

This platform changes that.

## 🎯 Core Purpose

To create an inclusive, AI-driven platform where **every Nigerian**—regardless of literacy, age, or tech exposure—can voice their opinions on government policies, and those opinions can be **analyzed and visualized in real-time** to help the government make better, people-centric decisions.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1. For Literate/Tech-Savvy Citizens
- Submit feedback via WhatsApp, Web App, or directly upload audio/text
- Receive acknowledgments or policy updates

### 2. For Non-Literate/Low-Tech Users
- Voice notes via feature phones or public booths
- USSD forms and on-ground volunteers collect voice data

### 3. AI Bridges the Gap
- **Speech-to-Text (Whisper)** handles local accents
- **Sentiment Analysis (Transformers)** detects tone (anger, hope, frustration)
- Data is aggregated, visualized, and sent to **Google Sheets Dashboards**

## 🔍 Features
- Accepts voice or text input from diverse user groups
- Real-time audio transcription (Whisper)
- Sentiment analysis of feedback
- Grouped data per post/policy
- Interactive dashboard (optional: Streamlit UI)
- Google Sheets sync for real-world usage

## 📊 Impact & Uniqueness
- **Solves a Real Problem**: Inclusive feedback system
- **Accessible**: Works beyond English or internet
- **Scalable**: For any national/state policy
- **AI-Powered**: Combines Whisper, gTTS, NLP, Google Sheets
- **Empowering**: Rural voices count as much as urban ones
